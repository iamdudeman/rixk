# Rixk

---
## Program Description
This is a text-based version of the popular board game Risk. It supports custom modding of the AI through a Java API as well as the possibility for user made maps. This project is to fulfill the project 1 requirement for my Software Engineering in 2015 and to explore the difficulties of using the Waterfall method in software development. It was later uploaded here to GitHub.

This was a joint effort between me and [@BrintMontgomery](https://github.com/BrintMontgomery) though there is no commit history since it was not originally developed on GitHub.
